# MW.Budgeting
A budgeting program based on YNAB4 (the desktop app) and designed to replace it if they drop support or break stuff. 
Will be completely developed by hand and streamed over at twitch.tv/mephi_dross, for those interested in that stuff. 
Mostly for my own private use and to teach some friends about programming, so I don't really care if other people want to build upon what I've started.
